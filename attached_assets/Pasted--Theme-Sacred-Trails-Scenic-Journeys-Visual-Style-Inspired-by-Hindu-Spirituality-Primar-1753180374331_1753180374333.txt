🎨 Theme: “Sacred Trails & Scenic Journeys”

🕉️ Visual Style Inspired by Hindu Spirituality

Primary Colors:

Saffron (#FF9933) – evokes devotion, purity, and the spirit of pilgrimage.

Indigo/Navy Blue (#2C3E50) – adds depth, balance, and professionalism.

Earthy Beige (#F7F1E1) – a soft background color that evokes Himalayan temples, ashrams, and peace.

Accent Colors:

Forest Green (#2E8B57) – for nature, forests, adventure trips.

White or light cream – used for purity and calmness.

Fonts:

Use a serif font for headings (e.g., Playfair Display or Gloock) to give a traditional, elegant feel.

Use a clean sans-serif font for body text (e.g., Poppins, Open Sans, or Inter) for modern readability.

🖼️ Imagery & Icons

Use a mix of:

Temple silhouettes, bells, Trishul, rudraksha, and Himalayan landscapes for spiritual tours.

Nature icons, tents, rafting gear, or sunrises for adventure/general packages.

Background textures like subtle mandala patterns, faded temple carvings, or cloud/mist overlays.

✨ Animations

Scroll-based animations (fade-in/up, zoom, or parallax) that feel peaceful, not too flashy.

E.g., when you scroll to a package, it could gently float in with a soft bell sound effect (optional).

📌 Text Language Tone

Use emotionally engaging headlines, like:

"Walk the Path of the Divine"

"From the Peaks of Kedarnath to the Rapids of Rishikesh"

"Journeys for the Soul and the Senses"

Mix devotional lines for Chardham packages with exciting taglines like:

“Raft the Ganga”, “Camp Under the Stars”, “Trek the Untamed Trails”
